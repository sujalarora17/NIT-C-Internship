# Visual Interface for Handwritten Character Recognition

This project was developed during my AI Internship at 
National Institute of Technology Calicut (May 2025 – July 2025).

## Project Overview
A deep learning-based OCR system for handwritten character recognition. 
The system includes a full-stack web interface built using FastAPI (backend) 
and React (frontend) for real-time handwritten text prediction.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- FastAPI
- React
- Deep Learning

## Features
- Image upload functionality
- Real-time handwritten text prediction
- REST API integration
- Interactive user interface

## Note
Due to large project size and model files, the complete project source code 
is available in the **Releases section** of this repository as a ZIP file.
