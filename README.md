## Project Overview

A deep learning-based system for **handwritten character recognition (OCR)** integrated with a full-stack visual interface.  

The backend is built using **FastAPI**, and the frontend is developed using **React**, enabling real-time handwritten text prediction and interactive document digitization workflows.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI  
- **Frontend:** React, Vite  
- **Machine Learning:** Deep Learning-based OCR  
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub

## Key Features

- Image upload functionality  
- Real-time handwritten text prediction  
- REST API integration between frontend and backend  
- Interactive and user-friendly web interface  
- Document digitization support

## Note

Due to large project size and model files, the complete project (including large assets) is also available in the **Releases section** as a ZIP file.

Environment files such as `.env`, `.venv`, and `node_modules` are intentionally excluded from this repository.
